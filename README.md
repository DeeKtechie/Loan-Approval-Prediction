# 💼 Loan Approval Prediction
Welcome! This notebook explores how we can simulate loan approval likelihood using a machine learning model — specifically, a Random Forest classifier trained on historical application data.

Our goal is to:

Understand which features most influence approval decisions
Simulate approval scores based on user-defined inputs
Visualize model performance and feature contributions
